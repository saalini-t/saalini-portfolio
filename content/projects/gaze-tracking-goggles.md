## Description

I developed a toolbar using PyQt6, which functions as a versatile interface equipped with a file document icon.

The toolbar is movable, allowing users to reposition it anywhere on the screen, offering flexibility in its use. This makes it an adaptable component for various software applications, providing a convenient way to integrate essential functions like file management or other key features. Its modular design ensures that it can be seamlessly incorporated into any software project, enhancing user interaction with intuitive controls.
