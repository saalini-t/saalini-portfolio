## Description
I created a PyQt6-based graphical user interface (GUI) to build an intuitive and user-friendly tool for counting the number of characters in a text file. The primary goal of this interface was to provide users with a seamless experience, where they can simply load a text file and immediately obtain a character count.

Use Case:

This character counting interface is highly useful for writers, editors, and anyone working with text who needs to monitor the length of their content. Whether for articles, social media posts, or coding documentation, the tool provides an efficient solution for determining text length at a glance.
