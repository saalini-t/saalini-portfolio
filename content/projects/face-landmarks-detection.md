## Description

I developed a memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that challenges players to match pairs of cards. The game begins by displaying a grid of face-down cards, each containing an image or symbol. When a player clicks on a card, it flips over to reveal its content. The objective is to find matching pairs by remembering the locations of previously revealed cards.

The game includes features such as a timer and a move counter to track the player's performance. The design is visually engaging with responsive animations, making it suitable for different screen sizes. Additionally, I implemented logic to ensure that the game resets once all pairs are matched, offering a new random arrangement of cards for replayability.
