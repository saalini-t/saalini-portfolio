## Intro
I developed a pizza website that offers users a seamless experience for ordering, customizing, and providing feedback on their pizzas. Here's an explanation of each feature

Pizza Ordering System:
The website provides an intuitive interface where users can browse through various pizza options, including classic favorites and specialty pizzas.

One of the standout features of the website is the ability for users to fully customize their pizzas. Customers can choose their pizza size (e.g., small, medium, large), crust type (e.g., thin, deep dish, gluten-free), and toppings. A wide variety of toppings are offered, from traditional options like pepperoni and mushrooms to gourmet choices like truffle oil or arugula. The customization interface is likely interactive, allowing users to see a visual representation of their pizza as they make changes.

Feedback System:
After placing an order, customers have the option to leave feedback about their pizza experience. The feedback system is simple to use, offering both a star rating system and a text box for detailed comments. Users can provide feedback on various aspects of the service, such as pizza quality, delivery time, and customer service. This feature helps gather valuable input, allowing the business to improve its offerings based on customer preferences.
