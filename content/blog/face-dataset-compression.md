# Introduction

My first hackathon experience was incredibly thrilling and memorable. I was selected to advance to the finals, which was a major milestone and a testament to the hard work and creativity invested in the project. The competition was intense, and the atmosphere was filled with excitement and innovation.

For this hackathon, I developed a travel itinerary website that featured personalized elements to enhance the user experience. The site included tools for flight booking, finding nearby restaurants, and booking hotels, all tailored to individual preferences. It was a great opportunity to showcase my skills and create something that could genuinely assist travelers in planning their trips more effectively. The entire journey from concept to final presentation was exhilarating, and it was an honor to be recognized in such a competitive environment.
