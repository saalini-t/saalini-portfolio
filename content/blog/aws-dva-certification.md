# Introduction
Participating in the Major League Hackathon was an incredibly rewarding experience. I was tasked with a variety of challenges that pushed me to think creatively and improve my technical skills. The sessions were highly informative, and I gained a wealth of knowledge from both the tasks and the interactions with fellow participants. As a bonus, I was rewarded with fun prizes like stickers, which made the experience even more enjoyable. Overall, it was an excellent opportunity for learning and growth, and I'm excited to apply what I've learned in future projects.
