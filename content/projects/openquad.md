## Description

I developed a calculator using PyQt6, a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This project involved designing a functional calculator with a clear layout and interactive buttons for performing arithmetic operations.

### Applications Used:
- **PyQt6**: For building the user interface of the calculator, allowing the design of buttons, display areas, and managing the layout.
- **Python**: The core programming language used to implement the logic behind the calculator’s functions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Modules Imported:
- **`sys`**: Used to handle command-line arguments and properly exit the application.
- **`PyQt6.QtWidgets`**: Provides the primary GUI elements, including `QMainWindow`, `QPushButton`, `QVBoxLayout`, and others, which were essential for constructing the interface.
- **`PyQt6.QtCore`**: Manages the application’s core functionality, like signals and slots for handling button clicks and other interactions.
- **`PyQt6.QtGui`**: Used for managing graphical elements such as icons and fonts to enhance the calculator’s appearance.
