## Description

I developed a language translator using the Googletrans library for translation and PyQt for the user interface. This project allows users to input text, select the desired source and target languages, and get the translation displayed instantly.

Key Components:
Googletrans: This Python library interacts with Google Translate to handle translations between multiple languages.
PyQt: Used to create the GUI, where users can enter text, select languages from dropdown menus, and view the translated output in a clean and intuitive interface.
